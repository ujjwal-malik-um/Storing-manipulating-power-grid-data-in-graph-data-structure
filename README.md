# Storing-manipulating-power-grid-data-in-graph-data-structure
A power grid system where data of connected houses with different propagators are stored using graph data structures in Python. The goal is to perform operations such as addition, removal of houses and propagators from the designed structure. Here we are using dictionary as an adjacency list to store the data in graph.
- [ ] Checking if a house is connected to a propagator
- [ ] Adding a house in the propagator's connected houses list
- [ ] Removing a house from the propagator's connected houses list
- [ ] Adding a house, propagator directly to the Power Grid after extracting relevant info fromm csv file
- [ ] Removing a propagator
