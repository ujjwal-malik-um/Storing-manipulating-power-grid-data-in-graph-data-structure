# Storing-manipulating-power-grid-data-in-graph-data-structure
A power grid system where data of connected houses with different propagators are stored using graph data structures in Python. The goal is to perform operations such as addition, removal of houses and propagators from the designed structure. Here we are using dictionary as an adjacency list to store the data in graph.
